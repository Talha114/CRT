# CRT

A classic "match-three" puzzle game written in assembly (MASM). The game involves swapping two adjacent candies among several on the game board to make a row or column of at least 3 matching candies, which are then removed from the board. The game is split into different levels, which must be completed in sequence.

## Levels

### Level 1
- Displays a title page with the game name.
- Takes the name of the user and displays it on the screen.
- Displays the rules of the game.
- Has a 7x7 board filled with random candies of different colors and shapes.
- When a candy is swapped with another candy, if a combo exists, the combo is crushed, dropped, and score is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the candies are swapped back!
- The board also has a color bomb which destroys all of its occurrences when swapped with a candy.
- When candies are crushed, score is awarded. The score depends on the type of candies that are crushed as each candy has different score.
- All candies of the same shape and color should have the same score.

## How to Update SCORE AND MOVES
- During crushing, the score added depends on the size of the combo. A combo of 3 adds 3 to the score. A combo of 4 will add 4 and so on.
- During explosion, the added score depends on how many occurrences are destroyed and from which location they are destroyed.
- The user is given a total of 15 moves in each level.
- There is a certain threshold score that is needed to clear each level. If any user fails to reach the threshold score, then it must ask the user to try again. A keystroke from the keyboard is used for that purpose.

## File Handling
- All Individual levels score will be saved in the file.
- Stores the highest score and player name in the same file.
- Record in a file should look like in the format given below:
```
Player’s Name
Level 1: 20
Level 2: 30
Level 3: 46
Highest Score: 46
```

## Procedures
The following procedures/macros are used for performing the game:
- `populateBoard`: populates the board using random candies generated by interrupt.
- `drawBoard`: draws the board using graphical features.
- `updateBoard`: checks for combinations, crushes them, auto-fills, and drops until all the combos are removed from the array.
- `checkCombo`: checks for combos in a loop unless and until the value of ‘crush’ variable is set to 0.
- `takeInput`: uses the 33h mouse interrupt to check when the mouse is pressed.
- `initiateBomb`: destroys all candies of that row or column through which candy is swapped by bomb.
- `drawString`: draws the player's name,
